Kernel headers for test builds. Do not use for production builds.

- linux/rseq.h

  It is a copy from the upstream Linux v5.0 kernel uapi.

  It also contains definitive system call number definitions for the rseq
  system call, in case the kernel uapi headers are not recent enough
  to define them.
