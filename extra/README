Kernel headers for test builds. Do not use for production builds.

- linux/rseq.h

  It is a copy from the upstream Linux v5.0 kernel uapi.

  It also contains definitive system call number definitions for the rseq
  system call, in case the kernel uapi headers are not recent enough
  to define them.


- linux/do_on_cpu.h

  It is a copy from the Linux rseq tree (not upstream yet):

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rseq/linux-rseq.git/
  tag: v5.1.16-rseq-20190725

  It also contains system call number definitions for the do_on_cpu
  system call (not yet upstream), which will likely change before
  being integrated upstream.
